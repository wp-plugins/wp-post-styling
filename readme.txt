Allows you to define custom styles for any specific post or page on your WordPress site. This is particularly useful for journal-style publications which want to provide a unique character for specific articles.

== Description ==

This plugin simply provides a custom field on your WordPress interface where you can add custom styles to be applied only on that page or post. Useful for being able to publish articles with a unique look.

The use you'll get out of this plugin depends on the flexibility of the theme you're using and your own knowledge of CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `wp-post-styling` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin using the `Plugins` menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > WP Post Styling
4. Adjust the WP Post Styling options if necessary. 
5. Set up custom styles for your posts and pages as needed!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I don't really know CSS. Can I use this plugin? =

You really do need to know CSS to get anywhere with this. Given the huge variety in styles provided by WordPress themes, it's impractical to attempt to predict what kinds of styles you might need. 

= The Custom styles I added aren't showing up in my blog -- why not? =

Well, this is just a stab in the dark, but it's possible that the developer of your theme didn't use the WordPress function <code>wp_head</code>, which needs to be in your theme for this plugin to work.
